# Deep-speech-based-Automated-Speech-Recognition-Engine-training-on-Indian-Accents
 Deep Speech is a state-of-art speech recognition system is developed using end-to-end deep learning, it is trained using well-optimized Recurrent 
Neural Network (RNN) training system utilizing multiple Graphical Processing 
Units (GPUs). This training is mostly done using American-English accent 
datasets, which results in poor generalizability to other English accents. India is 
a land of vast diversity. This can even be seen in the speech, there are several 
English accents which vary from state to state. In this work, we have used 
transfer learning approach using most recent Deep Speech model i.e. 
deepspeech-0.9.3 to develop an end-to-end speech recognition system for 
Indian-English accents. This work utilizes fine-tuning and data argumentation to 
further optimize and improve the Deep Speech ASR system. Indic TTS data of 
Indian-English accents is used for transfer learning and fine-tuning the pretrained Deep Speech model.

A modified train.py need to be changed in DeepSpeech repository
